1. The immutable variable "young master" is created as an instance of Customer classed
2. 15 is passed as value to the Customer class as a primary constructor (age)
3. The try block is executed
4. The buyCigarettes Function is called taking the object as the parameter
5. It validates the age variable of the object of Customer class. Is it less than 16 or not?
6. Value of "age" is 15 so it moves to else block
7. The class Cigarettes is instantiated into an object



object Task5{

  case class Customer(age: Int)

  class Cigarettes

  case class UnderAgeException(message: String) extends Exception(message)

  def buyCigarettes(customer: Customer): Cigarettes =
    if (customer.age < 16)
      throw UnderAgeException(s"Customer must be older than 16 but was ${customer.age}")
    else new Cigarettes

  val youngCustomer = Customer(15)
  try {
    buyCigarettes(youngCustomer)
    "Yo, here are your cancer sticks! Happy smokin'!"
  } catch {
    case UnderAgeException(msg) => msg
  }
}
